# Organisation profile

## Descriptions 

These descriptions will be displayed on the organization list page (Short Description) and on your organization's page (Long Description). [More details](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/org-profile#descriptions).

The Long Description may include [limited Markdown](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/markdown).

### Short description (180 characters)

> Replace Firefox's default control mechanism with one modelled on the one true editor, Vim. Our Firefox add-on has about 10,000 users, most of whom are programmers.

### Long description (2000 characters)

> # A browser extension for programmers
> 
> Our extension for Firefox, Tridactyl, is used by about 10,000 users every day. It aims to make controlling Firefox more like controlling Vim, a popular text editor. We aim to make as much as possible within the browser programmable; our users have, for example, created keyboard shortcuts to clone a project they are viewing on GitHub and open a terminal in that directory.
> 
> Our users are generally skilled programmers who want to have more control over their browser.

## Proposals

Enter tags that students can select (one) from and apply to their own proposals to help organize them. Examples: New Feature, Optimization. You can also use these to designate "sub-organizations" if you are an umbrella organization.

# 2020 application

## Your details

### Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code? (1000 chars)

> We'd like to get one or two regular contributors. We have lots of ideas for cool things that could be done with the project but haven't had much time to do them recently.

### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students? (1000 chars)

> We have a private chatroom for the mentors and key developers. We'll ensure that the mentors give brief reports on their students in this chat room every week or so.
> 
> We will make sure that mentors are not pressured to take on students and projects that they are not very interested in. We expect that this will help to ensure that the mentors are enthusiastic and want to see the students successfully complete their projects.

### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects? (1000 chars)

> We will encourage them to make use of "issues" and "milestones" on GitHub. With the students, we will set deadlines for small units of work so that it will become apparent early on if problems have arisen.
> 
> Mentors will have weekly one-on-one "meetings" with their students, ideally over video but in a real-time chatroom or email depending on the student's wishes. Mentors will only mentor projects they personally wish to see completed so we hope that their enthusiasm will be infectious.
> 
> Finally, each student-mentor pair will have a backup mentor in case there is a problem with the first.

### How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC? (1000 chars)

> We will invite all of the students to our public chat room and encourage them to submit their work through pull requests and organise themselves by filing issues in public.
> 
> If the developers meet up in person throughout the course of the summer the students will be invited to this too. We previously held a week-long retreat which was a great success.

### How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC ends? (1000 chars)

> The students will be encouraged to "watch" the GitHub repository and take ownership of their code should issues arise in the future. We hope that they will naturally stay in the chat room and answer newcomers questions as they become experts in our project.

### Anything else we should know? (500 chars)
