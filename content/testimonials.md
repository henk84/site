Here are a few of our favourite testimonials:

---

[Jeff King](https://github.com/peff), co-author of `git`, June 2018

> I'm mostly just a user of tridactyl


---

[burntsushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi), author of `ripgrep` (generally embarrassingly prolific in the Rust and Go ecosystems), October 2019:

> If Mozilla prevents me from using tridactyl, then it’s likely that I move back to Chrome.

The following are all taken from the [Mozilla reviews page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/reviews/).

> Firefox is basically useless without this addon.

> Browsing internet without it feels slow and clumsy.

> It's fast, responsive and actively developed.

> Super extensions pour naviguer avec les raccourcis vim

> they're doing their best.

> The more and more and I use it the more bugs I find

> its not as good as pentadactyl

> It's still pretty buggy and still slows things down, but the experience is totally worth it.

> The in-browser tutorial is the cherry on top :)

> It used to be pretty useless

> I almost wet myself when CTRL + ^(6) and . started working again

> Overrides the homepage and there is no configuration. Otherwise It's alright I guess

> using tridactyl does leave me feeling a bit disabled

> 1) the plugin sets your home page without asking you ― haven't seen this behaviour in a long time, and certainly not in opensource world;
> 2) doesn't work on some sites (many of those, actually);
> 3) no easy access to settings;
> 4) no whitelist.
> 
> for a plugin that is expected to _enhance_ my user experience that's a _fail_ in my book.
