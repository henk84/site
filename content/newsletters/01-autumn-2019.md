Hi!

It's been an eventful few months for Tridactyl. We were delisted from the AMO and have been slowly trying to get listed again. We're currently waiting to hear back from a reviewer on a query of ours before we submit what we will hope be our final revision which will be accepted. To have a hope of being relisted we have had to do some stuff we didn't want to do, namely editing `user.js` for some users without their consent - that issue details it all.

In light of this, the maintainer for our Arch Linux builds switched to a method which means that Mozilla does not have to sign Tridactyl - so they no longer get a say in what Arch Linux can or cannot provide for its users. If you're using Arch, I'd suggest you switch to these builds for peace of mind: `pacman -S firefox-tridactyl`.

There are some new features in Tridactyl 1.17.0 too: you can now use `source --url` to source an RC file from a URL without using the native messenger and `extoption` allows you to open the option pages of other extensions. We will probably release 1.18.0 soon which, hopefully, will make `source` a little more reliable which has been a perennial request from users with complex RC files.

A major reason that I'm writing this post is because bovine3dom has been accepted on to GitHub Sponsors. This initiative is a little like Patreon but Microsoft will match (i.e. double) any donations you make until October 2020 and charge no fees. You may wish to consider switching to this - simply follow this link: https://github.com/users/bovine3dom/sponsorship

Thanks as ever for your support,

bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers
